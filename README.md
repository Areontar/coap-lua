To use this script with Wireshark copy the file coap18.lua into the "plugins" folder of Wireshark (e.g. ~/.wireshark/plugins for Ubuntu).

Supported versions:

- CoAP Protocol (Draft 18)
- CoAP Observe (Draft 11)
- CoAP Blockwise Transfer (Draft 14)

Note: This script needs LUA 5.2 (which for sure is available in Wireshark 1.10.5)
